-- Brute Force Method --
(will probably take a really really really really long time)


Begin at upper left-hand corner.
1. Place knight in the next available spot
   (can be easily determined by drawing the L shape on the chessboard).
2. Repeat step 1
Continue until
  a) All squares have been visited. (The Knight's Tour is done!)
  b) You reach a square with no next available spots.
      - go to the last spot visited by the knight and choose a different spot
          (that is, the spot that does not have any more solutions)
