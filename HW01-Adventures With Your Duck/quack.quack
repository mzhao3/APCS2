HW01 -- ...We Go!
2018-01-30   

I brought my ducky to my workplace (which is a pool) the day before finals. Although Chicken canâ€™t swim, seeing his bright yellow face helped me get through my day (he has been replaced by another ducky though, now that I need him for coding again. Duty calls!) When I was finished with my shift, he and I had a review session about inheritance, and other assorted topics from my trusty APCS book. Later that day, he also moderated a group video call where we went over old test problems and solutions.
